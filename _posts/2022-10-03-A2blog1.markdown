The first experiment was a cinema seat selection experiment. I set up the general framework of the page in css to create a cinema-like seat selection page.
I made the box grey before it was clicked and orange after it was clicked.
Then I set the box in Java, adding it and assigning a value to the text if there was no click class; otherwise, clearing the click class and leaving the text empty.
