The third experiment was to create a magnifying glass of an image so that when the mouse hovered over a part of the image, a hover box would appear to magnify that part.
I chose a game photo as the base image
The overall goal of my js was to mouse over and a small div (masking layer) and a large div (display effect area) would appear on the image, mouse over and hide the small div, large div.
To do this, first set that the small div moves in the opposite direction to the large one, after which I finish binding the mouse to the occlusion layer so that the mouse moves a distance greater than the distance the occlusion layer moves.
After that the core of this magnifying glass function will be set, setting the whole magnifying glass function to exist in a ratio (small div/small image = large div/large image), (100 / 300 = 300 / 900).
Finally the distance between the large and small boxes is set by judging the distance moved.
Small div move distance
            smallDiv.style.left = x+'px';
            smallDiv.style.top = y+'px';
 distance to move the big image
            bigImg.style.left = -3*x+'px';
            bigImg.style.top = -3*y+'px';
