For the final project I wanted to create a piano key that would allow the user to click on different keys of the piano to make the corresponding key sound.

When creating the site I looked at a number of websites that used the piano as a design element and decided that a large, simple piano key would be the best way to maximise the user's experience of playing the piano.

The logic of my code design is to first create a button for the piano keys, matching the corresponding sound of the keys, then design the colour, length and width of the keys through CSS to build the basis of the site's appearance, and finally create the events for the keys through JScript, and then input the corresponding audio data, which will eventually emit the corresponding shen by clicking on the keys.
