# I need to make a birthday surprise!
October 26th is my roommate's birthday, it just so happens that in coding assignment3 we need to use code to interact with our lives, a little ritual I wanted to give my friend some sense of ritual, so I had a plan to make a birthday present for my roommate using vs code üéÅ .

The beginning of me is also very confused, roommate birthday gift to have what elements it, so I have to go to interrogate my own, roommate like which things, after thinking for a long time, I have the answer, these elements are.
fireworks
Starry sky
The words "Happy Birthday"
Looking up at the stars of the little man

# My sketch: A fireworksüéÜ feast, staged under the starsüåÉ
I started with this sketch in my notebook.

# Happy Birthday Chinese Strokes
My vision for the font floating in the air was to write the four words Happy Birthday in one stroke, as if someone had written birthday wishes in the sky, so I searched the Internet for a large library of resources that fit my requirements, and finally found such a library[https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer)
So I followed the tutorial and started designing

JS

# Design of web background
This is the background design of the web page.

It looks simple, but in fact there are many details they are.
The curvature of the ground, the
sky, the earth, the gradation of the color of the characters, the
character shape composition.

CSS

I gave the ground three times the width and made it an ellipse by border-radius 50% and centered it by positioning it, and finally gave the container an overflow: hidden

The composition of a small figure is actually a circle (head), a rectangle (torso), three ellipses (two arms + the arc under the upper body), and two triangles (two legs) that are then positioned and put together.

# Flashing effect
The blinking effect is actually animated with keyframes

# Fireworks effect
The effect of fireworks I was looking for an engineer's tutorial on the Internet, this is the link to his teaching

Afterwards, I blast fireworks at random locations after the dynamic text disappears

# Interesting points of this code
The code took me a long time to design, and since it was a secret birthday present I didn't tell my roommate that I asked him to prepare the surprise, and I stayed in my room for the past few days to design the code.
I was very happy when my roommate was surprised to see this gift, because it was the first digital gift I gave to someone and the first digital gift my roommate received.
In the future, if a friend in another country has a birthday, I can carefully prepare a digital birthday gift for him, which will not only impress my friends, but also allow me to receive the convenience and happiness that the code brings to me.
