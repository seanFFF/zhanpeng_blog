# I need to make a birthday surprise!
October 26th is my roommate's birthday, it just so happens that in coding assignment3 we need to use code to interact with our lives, a little ritual I wanted to give my friend some sense of ritual, so I had a plan to make a birthday present for my roommate using vs code 🎁 .

The beginning of me is also very confused, roommate birthday gift to have what elements it, so I have to go to interrogate my own, roommate like which things, after thinking for a long time, I have the answer, these elements are.
fireworks
Starry sky
The words "Happy Birthday"
Looking up at the stars of the little man

# My sketch: A fireworks🎆 feast, staged under the stars🌃
I started with this sketch in my notebook.
